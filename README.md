# WordPress Downloader

This script simplifies download and installation of the WordPress.

You have to place a single `wp_downloader.php` file to your server and start the installation with just **one click**.

## Download

Go to [releases](https://github.com/kildom/wp_downloader/releases/latest) to download latest `wp_downloader.php` file.

## Rationale

Normally, you have to download release ZIP file, unpack it, send over **2500 small files** to your server and then start the installation.
This approach is especially inconvenient if you have unstable or slow FTP connection or you want to do it fast.

This downloader resolves above inconvenience.
